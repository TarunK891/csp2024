<img src="statuscheck.jpg" height="200" class="aligncenter">
<p>"We were given a problem with the fish tank monitoring system, that it was reading the environmental factors and chemical levels were way off then what they were supposed to be. We fixed the problem by changing the range list and other values so that the levels would be optimal for the fish tank."</p>

<h3>This is my scratch program template</h3>
<img src="scratchprogram.jpg" height="200" class="aligncenter">
<p>"We have used procedures to define the movement of the square in the game. Ee have an opening animation before our game starts. we use multiple backgrounds throughout the game/animation. The square changes costumes whenever it takes damage. We have added music in the background throughout the game. We have created events that start each of the levels. The player inputs w,a,s, d, and space to move the square around."</p>

<h3>This is my sixth project, Rover Phone Home</h3>
<img src="Desert.JPG" height="200" class="aligncenter">
<p>"In conclusion we believe the rover is in the Desert region. Based on the 4 data groups given and the graphs we drew for each region we identified that the data best matched the graphs of the desert region. We believe that graph 1 is temperature, graph 2 is sound, graph 3 is gyroscope, and graph 4 is light.
